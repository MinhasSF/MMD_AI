The overall dataset comprises a total of 11,970 pulses, representing nine different classes. 
The number of pulses per class is 1330.
Signals from nine targets air, APM, pins, minrl, minrl +APM, minrl + pins, sand, sand + APM and sand + pins are prsesent.

The dataset is populated with synchronized pulse data from next generation MMD. 
The pulse repetition frequency, including both pulses, is 880Hz.
The number of pulses M obtained per class is 1330, representing concatenated positive and negative pulses. 
It is done to simplify the model,with a total number of concatenated samples being N=244, consisting of 122 samples from each received pulse (positive & Negative), respectively. 
The first 122 samples are from positive and the next 122 samples are from negative pulses. 
Total of 1330 pulses with 1330 positive positive pulses and 1330 negative pulses are transmitted through sensor. 
It is approximately 3 seconds of pulsed data per class.
